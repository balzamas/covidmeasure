   <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
   <p id="grande">Disclaimer: With the reopenings it became nearly impossible to track the countries, as most switched to local measures.<br>Most of the country measures are not up-to-date.</p>
   <p id="grande">With the regionalization, I now focus more on Switzerland, and keep the measures there always up to date.</p>
   <p id="grande">Data like cases, deaths and positive rate are updated automatically and still valid.</p>
   <p id="grande">For current rules in a country, please check their official sites.<br>
     Avoid making simple comparisons - just implementing or abolish a measure is not the single reason to influence the number of infections.</p>
     <p id="grande">An example for a scientific research is <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/04/24/2020.04.16.20062141.full.pdf" target="_blank">The estimated impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions ondocumented cases of COVID-19: A cross-country analysis</a>, a study from Switzerland.</p>
     <p id="grande">Always look at the bigger picture. But it this site might be helpful as a starter to dig into a research.</p>
     <p id="grande">And if you see a mistake - please let me know! We need you, as a local or why every you know what you know (we love sources!)!</p>

<h3>Who am I</h3>
   <p id="grande">
   I am a random dude on the internet, without any professional expertise in medicine or statistics. <br>
   I just needed a project during the lockdown to keep me sane, as all my hobbies were forbidden in that time.<br>
   Because I love data, statistics and politics I started this site. I was confused by the different claims <br>
   what each country does as a reaction to Covid-19, so I wanted to have this information in one place.<br>
   I make changes because I feel I need it presented in another way - simply because I want. Or I want to try a new technology.

<h3>Give me the data</h3>
      <p>
        For Swiss measures, use this endpoint:<br>
        <a href="/measuremeterdata/chmeasures">here</a><br>
        You can use these filters:
        <ul>
          <li>cantons: cantons (short form like zh for Zurich, ch for measures on national level)</li>
          <li>types: measure types (see <a href="/measuremeterdata/chmeasuretypes/">here</a> for the list with ids</li>
          <li>start: only show measures who started after this date (iso date)</li>
          <li>end: only show measures who ended before this date (iso date)</li>
        </ul>
        Example: all mask measures from Geneva and Zurich, starting from August 8:<br>
        measuremeterdata/chmeasures/?cantons=ge,zh&types=2&start=2020-08-08<br>
        <p>All the Endpoints <a href="/measuremeterdata/">here</a>.<br>
          Of course it's not documented.</p>
