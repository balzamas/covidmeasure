   <h3>Why</h3>
   I started this website in Spring 2020 to cover the rules in the different countries.<br>
   I was looking for a central source to compare how the pandemic is handled and how countries are reopening.<br>
   It became more and more impossible to track all the rules and good sources appeared, that's why now most of the rules are imported from the Oxford University.<br>
   What's missing in the Oxford dataset are the restaurants and shops, this is still maintained by us. Please report any error to us!<br>


<h3>Who am I</h3>
   <p id="grande">
   I am a random dude on the internet, without any professional expertise in medicine or statistics. <br>
   I just needed a project during the lockdown to keep me sane, as all my hobbies were forbidden in that time.<br>
   Because I love data, statistics and politics I started this site. I was confused by the different claims <br>
   what each country does as a reaction to Covid-19, so I wanted to have this information in one place.<br>
   I make changes because I feel I need it presented in another way - simply because I want. Or I want to try a new technology.

<h3>Give me the data</h3>
      <p>
        For Swiss measures, use this endpoint:<br>
        <a href="/measuremeterdata/chmeasures">here</a><br>
        You can use these filters:
        <ul>
          <li>cantons: cantons (short form like zh for Zurich, ch for measures on national level)</li>
          <li>types: measure types (see <a href="/measuremeterdata/chmeasuretypes/">here</a> for the list with ids</li>
          <li>start: only show measures who started before this date (iso date)</li>
          <li>end: only show measures who ended after this date or have no end date (iso date)</li>
        </ul>
        Example: all mask measures from Geneva and Zurich, starting from August 8:<br>
        measuremeterdata/chmeasures/?cantons=ge,zh&types=2&start=2020-08-08<br>
        <p>All the Endpoints <a href="/measuremeterdata/">here</a>.<br>
          Of course it's not documented.</p>
