  <h4>Calculating the chance that one or more members of a group is/are infected.</h4>
  <p id="large">Based on the model of the <a href="https://covid19risk.biosci.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>.<br>
  Base number: Positive tests in the past X days per 100k population. CDC recommends to use past 10 days.<br>
    As there is no recent serology data about Switzerland, it's hard to estimate how many people are infected, but untested.<br>
    One large <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-67362031304-0/fulltext" target="_blank">seroprevalence study</a> was performed in Geneva in April. The results showed that for one case tested, there were 11.8 untestet.<br>
    This would mean a bias of 11.8 - but the test regime was different during these times and it's difficult to set the correct value.<br>
    Also a study in Ticino performed in May resulted roughly in a 1:10 ratio.<br>
    As default, the value of three is set, which is on the lower end I assume - but I am just a programmer.<br>
    For certain categories of events (schools, nightclubs), it would be very useful to filter by age group,<br>
    as the distribution of the virus varies greatly between the groups. This is not implemented yet.
  </p>
  <p id="large">Formula used: 100 - (((1-(1/(100000/(cases*bias)))) ** groupsize) * 100)</p>

  <p class="red"><b>Attention:</b> be aware, don't missuse it! Don't use it for your personal risk assessment!
    <br> "Oh, the chance that someone is infected at this party is only 9,3%? Let's go and hug everybody!"<br>
    Probabilities are tricky to understand - this tool is maybe more useful for decision makers/event organizers (keyword "Superspreader in closed space").<br>
    Disclaimer: I am not an epidemologist. I'm just a random dude from the internet.<br>
    Credit for the concept goes to Gatech, I just adapted their concept for Switzerland.<br>
    So: keep your distance, wash your hands, wear a mask where it's sensible, enjoy life but don't be stupid.
