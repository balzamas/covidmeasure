Heavy work in progress, but in an nutshell:

###Goal 
Data collection of corona measures in different countries.
Visualization by measures/countries

###API - REST Endpoints
https://www.coronameasures.ch/measuremeterdata/
To filter measures use parameters country_in= and type=

###Contribute
Contact my if you want to collaborate (collect data or code). 
Goal is to have local contributors for regions/countries to keep the data updated.
Framework is Django.

My JQuery/CSS/HTML is a nightmare, be warned.
