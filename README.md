# covidmeasures

Heavy work in progress, but in an nutshell:

Goal: 
Data colletion of corona measures in different countries.
Visualization by measures/categories

API - REST Endpoints:
http://address/measuremeterdata/
To filter measures use parameters country_in= and type=

Beta-System: http://5-102-145-137.cust.cloudscale.ch:8000/

My JQuery/CSS/HTML is a nightmare, be warned. 

Contact my if you want to collaborate (collect data or code).
Goal is to have contributors for regions/countries to keep the data updated.
Framework is Django.
