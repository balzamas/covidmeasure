Visualization by measures/countries

### API - REST Endpoints
https://www.covidlaws.ch/measuremeterdata/
Sorry, no manual yet.

### Contribute
Contact my if you want to collaborate (collect data or code). 
Goal is to have local contributors for regions/countries to keep the data updated.
Framework is Django.

My JQuery/CSS/HTML is a nightmare, be warned.
