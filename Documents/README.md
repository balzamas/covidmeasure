###How to categorize the data


####Dates
Start day: when the measure was introduced.
End day: The date when the measure was replaced by another one or when it was lifted.

Example: measure 1 was valid March 12, 13, 14, measure 2 started 15 and no end is known yet.

Measure 1 Start date: March 12, End date March 15.

Measure 2 Start date: March 15, End date none 

####Partial
When partial is NOT set, the measure is in full force. General rule: it's closed/in force, maybe with exceptions.
Usually this does not need a comment.

When partial is set, it's open, but with limitations/restrictions. Comment what are the limitations. 
If introduced gradually, document it in the same record (e.g. "From March 10: 10 people allowed, from March 21: 5 people allowed.")

####None
When a measure was never active or it was revoked, you can set a record to None. It's shown as a white bar in the chart.
Please do this when a measure never was in place, so visitors see if this topic was already researched by us.

#####For example
Restaurant without partial set: 

All restaurants have to be closed.

Restaurant with partial:

Example 1: All restaurants are open again but with restrictions like maximum people per table, strict hygiene concept and limited opening hours.

Example 2: Only restaurants to a certain size can be open, only outside areas are allowed, strict hygiene concept.
