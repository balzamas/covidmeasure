### How to categorize the data


#### Dates
Start day: when the measure was introduced.
End day: The date when the measure was replaced by another one or when it was lifted.

Example: measure 1 was valid March 12, 13, 14, measure 2 started 15 and no end is known yet.

Measure 1 Start date: March 12, End date March 15.

Measure 2 Start date: March 15, End date none 

### Regionality
Problem with most countries are regional rules. We use the measures on national level or when a significant part of the population is affected.

### Containment and closure policies
